# Streamer Privacy Tools

Tools to protect private information, mainly for streamers during their streams.

Only "hide-my-name.js" right now.

- hide-my-name.js: (Version 0.2) Hide given words (i.e. name and last name) from your browser by replacing them with other words. Install with a userscript manager (.i.e Violentmnokey) by open the file in your browser. After that edit the script (now in the userscript manager) with your name, and NEVER open and show the contents of the script during streams (it will have your name in it, duh). Breaks chating on Twitch. Test before using.

- hide-my-name-old.js: Same as above, less reliable.
